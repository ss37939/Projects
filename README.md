Hello! I'm Sarah Smith, and these are just a few projects I have been working on to better my understanding of python.

• Janken is just a regular game of rock, paper, scissor against a computer. Whenver you decide to end the game, both scores are displayed.
• NumberGuesser is just as it sounds. You will continuously try to guess the randomly generated number until you get it right. Then, once it is correctly guessed, you are shown how many times it took you to guess the number.
• The PasswordGenerator generates a password based on how long you want the password and what you want your password to consist of.
• The QuizGame has questions that you must answer correctly to earn points and get a good score. You have the option at the end to play again if you would like. I plan to increase the number of questions in the future. I also plan to possible have the questions be chosen at random, so it does not produce the same questions in the same order when wanting to replay.
• The SlotMachine has it's own desciption inside of the project!

Enjoy <3
